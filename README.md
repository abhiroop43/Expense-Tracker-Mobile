# 🤑 Flutter Expense Tracker

did it all go?" 💸

## 🚀 Getting Started

This project is your gateway to managing expenses like a pro (or at least pretending to). Whether

your rent ☕, this app has got you covered.

## 🗓️ Roadmap

Here's what we plan to add next (because who doesn't love a good to-do list?):

- [ ] Implement the backend (because we need a place to store all those
      "I spent how much on coffee?" moments) ☕💾
- [ ] Add notifications for expenses (because we all need a nudge sometimes) 📅
- [ ] Implement light mode (because dark mode isn't for everyone) 🌞
